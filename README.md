CCM Fitness is a site for a personal trainer designed to encourage women to get involved in physical exercise. CCM Fitness will be useful to people who are looking for motivation to get healthy. The site is mostly targeted towards women as that is the business owner's target market.

## Site Skeleton

I used the software Balsamiq to draw up simple wireframes to help with the design of the site. The following screenshots show the desktop browser and mobile browser (iPhone 5) for the index page, gallery and contact us page.

## Features

- Navbar
 
![chrome_kQFSIak4iF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140711-caaa6d69-dfc5-4f68-809c-7009f0195c4d.png)


The fully responsive navigation bar appears on every single page of the site. It consists of links to the homepage, gallery and the contact form. 
This feature allows the user to painlessly navigate the site's three pages without having to use any back button etc. 

- Logo on the homepage
![chrome_6nr2GUg69f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140497-216c8bb5-355c-4456-9f9b-49bf5d5b1c29.png)
The logo on the homepage is fully responsive and will occupy the same percentage of the page no matter what the size of the screen. The logo displays the name of the company and the services that they offer. 
The logo is brightly coloured and fits the colour scheme of the rest of the site. It is intended to be aestheticallty pleasing to the user whilst displaying the exact intentions of the site.

- Introduction and About Us
![chrome_KfOMJsEAT7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140749-e1ac3cf0-79b0-4ee6-b90c-ba7b3f81a7a0.png)

The introduction and about us page consists of two fully responsive paragraphs describes who the trainer is and is intended to build trust between the user and company. The user will be welcomed by motivating words to help entice them to dive deeper into the site.

- Gallery on Homepage

There is a small gallery of stock images taken from pexels.com. These pictures are fully responsive and will stack on top of each other when on a smaller screen. The images are relevant to the site and make the user experience better by improving how the website looks.

- Footer

The footer allows the user to locate the CCM Ftness social media pages as well as contact information and place of work. The footer is fully responsive and will be fully visable on all screens. The links open in a new window for better user experience.

- Price Table
![chrome_e6Z1BdgpTN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140780-062f444f-abe8-4ceb-beda-c51520fea817.png)

This table was created in html and exists to display the available programmes and prices so the user can decide which option that suits them best. Payment terms and conditions are included in a paragraph under the table. 

- Gallery Video
![chrome_37R9K1H0uZ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140803-f5b16fbd-dbff-4bf9-80a3-0ba5e01d6437.png)

A video was added thanks to personal content from CCM Fitness and exists to show the user exactly how the business operates through video evidence. The video starts muted and has controls to allow for a better user experience.

- Gallery Picture

Like the video these were added to give the user a good idea of what the programmes and sessions are like.

- Contact Form 
![chrome_OEPm2ALYXa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103134533/169140843-4418be9f-ce75-4690-b7e7-8714d8a2d6cc.png)

This form allows the user to transfer their details to CCM Fitness to start their journey towards health and fitness. They are helped by the various reviews and before/after pictures. The user will be asked to submit the required email address and name. They are provided with a reset button if they make a mistake. 

- Features left to implement 

I need to make the contact form send to CCM Fitness email address rather than CI formdump.
